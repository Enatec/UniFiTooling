### Semantic Versioning

We follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) 2.0.0 guidelines, whenever possible.

#### Version numbering

* `MAJOR` version with incompatibilities and/or possible breaking changes,
* `MINOR` version that add functionality in a mostly backwards-compatible manner
* `PATCH` version mostly backwards-compatible bug fixes and small changes.

Sometimes, we use additional labels for pre-release and build metadata, e.g. `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-Beta`.
If we run a special build, we also might append this to the regular format, e.g. `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD`.
