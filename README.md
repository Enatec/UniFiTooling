# UniFiTooling

This is an beta version for an PowerShell Module for the Ubiquiti [UBNT SDN Controller API](https://unifi-sdn.ui.com/).



I started this module as an internal helper for many automated updates for my UniFi Security Gateway Firewall Rules and do a few other things (automated). I migrated everything into a regular module and published it as open source after using it for a while.



I plan to release versions that cover more and more functions. However, I need to refactor and document the code before doing so.

### Use Cases

You will find some demo use cases within the [UseCases](https://github.com/Enatec/UniFiTooling/tree/master/release/UniFiTooling/UseCases) directory.

```powershell
# Install the module for the Current User
# with PowerShellGet directly from the Powershell Gallery, Preferred method
# Run in a regular or administrative PowerShell prompt (Elevated).
PS C:\> Install-Module -Name 'UniFiTooling' -Scope CurrentUser
```

##### Systemwide

```powershell
# Install the module for the All Users
# with PowerShellGet directly from the Powershell Gallery, Preferred method.
# Run this in an administrative PowerShell prompt (Elevated).
PS C:\> Install-Module -Name 'UniFiTooling' -Scope AllUsers
```

#### Manual Installation (unsupported)

```powershell
PS C:\> iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://github.com/Enatec/UniFiTooling/raw/master/Install.ps1")
```

#### Download from GitHub

You will find tha latest version in the [release page](https://github.com/Enatec/UniFiTooling/releases) of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Enatec/UniFiTooling/)

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/enatec/UniFiTooling.svg)](https://github.com/Enatec/UniFiTooling/releases/) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/enatec/UniFiTooling/total.svg)](https://github.com/Enatec/UniFiTooling/releases/) [![Download Size](https://badge-size.herokuapp.com/enatec/UniFiTooling/master/release/UniFiTooling-current.zip)](https://github.com/Enatec/UniFiTooling/blob/master/release/UniFiTooling-current.zip)

#### Clone the repository

Or clone this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Enatec/UniFiTooling/) to your local machine, extract, go to the `.\releases\UniFiTooling` directory and import the module to your session to test, but not install this module.

### Get started

After installation of the Module, open a PowerShell Session (regular or elevated).

#### Config

```powershell
PS C:\> New-UniFiConfig -UniFiUsername 'user' -UniFiPassword 'password' -UniFiProtocol 'https' -UniFiSelfSignedCert $true -UniFiHostname 'unifi.contoso.com' -UniFiPort '8443' -Path '.\UniFiConfig.json'
```

Replace the values with your needs. Please also see the detailed description below.

#### Connect

Before using any command, you need to login to the controller.

```powershell
PS C:\> Invoke-UniFiApiLogin
```

In version 1.0.8, this will change: You no longer need to login/authenticate. All commands will do a check and login/authenticate when needed.

##### Troubleshooting

This will show you the real error-message:

```powershell
PS C:\> Invoke-UniFiApiLogin -verbose
```

#### Execute any command

Execute any command now...

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-UnifiNetworkList
```

#### Logoff

You should logoff after you are done! The session will timeout, but this will clean up everything for you.

```powershell
PS C:\> Invoke-UniFiApiLogout
```

### Note

Early beta version, use at your own risk! Not ready for showtime (production) yet...

### Config

Keep this file in a secure place, especially in a shared environment. It contains the credentials (Yes, username and password) of your UniFi Admin User in plain text (human readable).

Here is a sample configuration:

```json
{
   "Login": {
      "Username": "adminuser",
      "Password": "AdminPassword"
   },
   "protocol": "https",
   "SelfSignedCert": true,
   "Hostname": "unifi.contoso.com",
   "Port": 443
}
```

#### Username

The login of a UniFi User with admin rights

#### Password

The password for the user given above. It is clear text for now. I know... But the Ubiquiti UniFi Controller seems to understand plain text only.

I plan to use a hashed and/or encryted version for a future version. But during the runtime, it is still as human readable clear text in memory and the `Invoke-UniFiApiLogin` furthermore, sends it as human readable clear text information within a JSON formatted body.

#### protocol

Valid is `http` and `https`. Please note: `http` is untested and it might not even work!

#### SelfSignedCert

If you use a self signed certificate and/or a certificate from an untrusted CA, you might want to use `true` here.
This is a Bool, but only `true` or `false` for now. I use this directly in PowerShell.

Please note: I can be dangerous to trust a certificate without checking it! I think it is OK to do within an Intranet, but I would avoid doing it over the public Internet! Especially with the `Invoke-UniFiApiLogin` command, because this will send the Credentials (Yes, username and password) of your UniFi Admin User in clear text in a JSON based body. If this is intercepted you might be in danger!

#### Hostname

The Ubiquiti UniFi Controller you want to use. You can use a Fully-Qualified Host Name (FQHN) or an IP address. Please note that your certificate must match the name and/or IP address as SAN name. Otherwise you might need to set the `SelfSignedCert` to `true`.

#### Port

The port number that you have configured on your Ubiquiti UniFi Controller.
